to git rid of the modal and the backdrop now we need to change the state again. from setModalOpen(true) to (false)

How do we do that?

{modalOpen && <Backdrop onCancel={closeModal} />}
// but this dont work
// we need to update the component itselft and pass this function

-- Backdrop.js

function Backdrop(props) {
    return <div className="backdrop" onClick={props.onCancel} />
}

export default Backdrop;

props is important for building reusable components
useState is important for changing what we see on screen
