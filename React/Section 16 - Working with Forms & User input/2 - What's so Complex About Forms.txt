When to validate?

When form is submitted:
	- Allows the user to enter a valid value before warning him/her
	- Avoid unnecessary warnings but maybe present feedback "too late"
	
When input is losing focus:
	- Allows the user to enter a valid value before warning.
	- Very useful for untouched forms
	
On every keystroke
	- Warns user before he/she had a chance of entering valid values
	- If applied only on invalid inputs, has the potential of providing more direct feedback.
