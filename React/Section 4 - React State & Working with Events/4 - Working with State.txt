NOTE: without a state occurred the default variable won't run again. Meaning if you change variable then it won't trigger an event.

To tell react that we need to run again we need to import something from react library.

NOTE: by default this is the code
	import React from 'react';
	
	now we need to add curly bracket to add state
	
	import React, { useState } from 'react';
	// useState is so called react hook. NOTE: there are other hooks as well.
	// NOTE: react hooks always start by 'use'
	// NOTE: react hooks should be called in the function. Not outside the function and not nested function!
	// useState return an array. so you can use array destructuring!
	
	const [title, setTitle] = useState(props.title);
	NOTE: useState always returns an array with 2 elements.
	NOTE: the first element is a pointer of that manageme value. or the value stored in props title.
		  the second element is a function which we can later call to set a new title or value. 
		  
-------------
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function ExpenseItem(props) {
    const [title, setTitle] = useState(props.title);

    const clickHandler = () => {
        setTitle('Updated')
    }
	return (
            <button onClick={clickHandler}>Change Title</button>
    );
}

// this time it will update the dom
