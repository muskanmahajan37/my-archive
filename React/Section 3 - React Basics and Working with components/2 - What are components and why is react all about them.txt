React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces

HTML, CSS & JavaScript are about building user interfaces as well.

Reacts makes building complex, interactive and reactive user interfaces simpler.

React is all about "Components"
	: Because all user interfaces in the end are made up of components

What is a "Components"
	: combination of html, and css code, and a javascript for logic.
	
	
Why components?
	: Reusability
	: Don't repeat yourself
	
	: Separation of Concern
	: Don't do too many things in one and the same place (function)
